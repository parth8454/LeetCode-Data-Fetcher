# LeetCode-Data-Fetcher
SUP! Guys... so one of my prof asked me to maintain leetcode record of students..
So one boring way was -- sending a google link once a week in our whatsapp so that students upload their details manually..

But i wanted to build a project as well as i also wanted another solution for this problem..

hence here is my webapp...

just enter your username and you will get you stats...

my next step is to link it with a database to store --- roll number and Leetcode username of student and link everything to a database...
